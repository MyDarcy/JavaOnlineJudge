 * Description:
 *
 *
 * Given an array A of length n whose entries are integers, compute the largest product
 * that can be made using n-1 entries in A. You cannot use an entry more than once.
 * Array entries may be positive, negative, or 0. Your algorithm cannot use the division
 * operator, explicitly or implicitly.
 *
 * Hint: Consider the products of the first i-1and the last n- i elements. Alternatively, count the
 * number of negative entries and zero entries.
