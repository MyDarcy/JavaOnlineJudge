 * Description:
 *
 * LCA: lowest common ancestor
 *
 * Design an algorithm that takes as input a BST and two nodes, and returns the LCA
 * of the two nodes. For example, for the BST in Figure 15.1 on Page 255, and nodes C
 * and G, your algorithm should return B. Assume all keys are distinct. Nodes do not
 * have references to their parents.
 *
 * Hint: Take advantage of the BST property
 *
